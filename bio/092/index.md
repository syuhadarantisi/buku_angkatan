I am a fan of Linux and other Open Source products. Rust and JavaScript are my favorite programming languages, but recently Rust has become more dominant. Even though I like it, I'm still learning about these technologies and I'm not quite adept at using them yet.

I will continue to try to develop my abilities by studying consistently. Then I will pass on the knowledge I have to others. I am sure that with that, the knowledge I get will not be in vain forgotten because it is always passed down. And finally, my hope is that in the future I can create a software system that can be used by many people.
